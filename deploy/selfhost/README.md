  <summary><b>Upgrading from v0.13.2 to v0.14.x</b></summary>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is one time activity for users who are upgrading from v0.13.2 to v0.14.0</p>

  As there has been significant changes to Self Hosting process, this step mainly covers the data migration from current (v0.13.2) docker volumes from newly created volumes

> Before we begin with migration, make sure your v0.14.0 was started and then stopped. This is required to know the newly created docker volume names.

Begin with downloading the migration script using below command

```

curl -fsSL -o migrate.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/master/deploy/selfhost/migration-0.13-0.14.sh

chmod +x migrate.sh

```

Now run the `./migrate.sh` command and expect the instructions as below

```
******************************************************************

This script is solely for the migration purpose only.
This is a 1 time migration of volume data from v0.13.2 => v0.14.x

Assumption:
1. Postgres data volume name ends with _pgdata
2. Minio data volume name ends with _uploads
3. Redis data volume name ends with _redisdata

Any changes to this script can break the migration.

Before you proceed, make sure you run the below command
to know the docker volumes

docker volume ls -q | grep -i "_pgdata"
docker volume ls -q | grep -i "_uploads"
docker volume ls -q | grep -i "_redisdata"

*******************************************************

Given below list of REDIS volumes, identify the prefix of source and destination volumes leaving "_redisdata"
---------------------
plane-app_redisdata
v0132_redisdata

Provide the Source Volume Prefix :
```

**Open another terminal window**, and run the mentioned 3 command. This may be different for users who have changed the volume names in their previous setup (v0.13.2)

For every command you must see 2 records something like shown in above example of `redisdata`

To move forward, you would need PREFIX of old setup and new setup. As per above example, `v0132` is the prefix of v0.13.2 and `plane-app` is the prefix of v0.14.0 setup

**Back to original terminal window**, _Provide the Source Volume Prefix_ and hit ENTER.

Now you will be prompted to _Provide Destination Volume Prefix_. Provide the value and hit ENTER

```
Provide the Source Volume Prefix : v0132
Provide the Destination Volume Prefix : plane-app
```

In case the suffixes are wrong or the mentioned volumes are not found, you will receive the error shown below. The image below displays an error for source volumes.

In case of successful migration, it will be a silent exit without error.

Now its time to restart v0.14.0 setup.
